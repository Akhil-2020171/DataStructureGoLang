# GoLang Data Structures Practice

This repository contains my practice of data structures in GoLang.

## Data Structures

# [Array](Arrays)

- ### Questions

- [Two Sum](Arrays/Two-Sum.go) - Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](Arrays/Best-Time-to-Buy-and-Sell-Stock.go) - Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

- [Contains Duplicate](Arrays/Contains-Duplicate.go) - Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.

- [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](Arrays/Find-Minimum-in-Rotated-Sorted-Array.go) - Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Find the minimum element.

- [Maximum Product Subarray](Arrays/Maximum-Product-Subarray.go) - Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

- [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](Arrays/Search-in-Rotated-Sorted-Array.go) - Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

- [3Sum](Arrays/3Sum.go) - Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

- [Container With Most Water](Arrays/Container-With-Most-Water.go) - Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
